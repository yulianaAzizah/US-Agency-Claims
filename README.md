# HOW TO DECREASE TSA CLAIMS?
---

## OVERVIEW
Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is part of the airport security system in America. TSA is designed to keep commercial airports and baggage secure throughout the America. TSA set high standards of the security. All passengers will be screened by a TSA agent before they continue their journey

In case of damage and or loss occurs after inspection process, the passenger can submit a claim for compensation for the damage and loss. Since the TSA was formed and the system started running, from 2002 the claims submitted were very high from year to year until the data to be analyzed at this time, 2015. Claims that have been submitted are various kinds, loss of goods after checking, baggage damage, and various other problems.

## POINT OF ANALYSIS
The high number of claims submitted by passengers to be a concern for the TSA. TSA must take immediate action to resolve the issue. TSA can carry out various kinds of improvements to be able to reduce the number of problem claims. The high number of claims submitted has a big impact on the costs that must be incurred by the TSA to make compensation. In this condition, TSA doesn't know the problem points of high claims. However the improvements to be made must be right on target so that they can have a significant impact.

This project analyzes the problem of the high number of claims. The results of this analysis can be used as a basis for the TSA to carry out improvements so it can reduce the number of claims submitted by passengers.
